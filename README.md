# python-cec - libcec bindings for Python

`python-cec` allows you to control your TV, reciever and other CEC-compliant HDMI devices from a python script on a computer. Most computer graphics cards don't support CEC; you'll need a [Pulse-Eight USB-CEC adapter](http://www.pulse-eight.com/store/products/104-usb-hdmi-cec-adapter.aspx) or a Raspberry Pi (Untested).

## Installing:

### Install dependencies
To build python-cec, you need version 1.6.1 or later of the libcec development libraries:

On Gentoo:
```
sudo emerge libcec
```

On OS X:
```
brew install libcec
```

Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install libcec-dev build-essential python-dev
```
Note: because Ubuntu ships an older version of libcec that lacks the ToggleMute function, that function will also be missing in python-cec

Rasbian:

I've done a custom build of a more recent libcec with Raspberry Pi support.
```
wget http://packages.namniart.com/repos/namniart.key -O - | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://packages.namniart.com/repos/pi wheezy main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libcec.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-dev build-essential libcec-dev cec-utils
```

### Install from PIP

```
pip install cec
```

## Getting Started

A simple example to turn your TV on:

```python
import cec

cec.init()

tv = cec.Device(0)
tv.power_on()
```

## API


```python
import cec

adapters = cec.list_adapters() # may be called before init()

cec.init() # use default adapter
cec.init(adapter) # use a specific adapter

cec.close()  # not implemented yet

cec.add_callback(handler, events)
# the list of events is specified as a bitmask of the possible events:
cec.EVENT_LOG
cec.EVENT_KEYPRESS
cec.EVENT_COMMAND # not implemented yet
cec.EVENT_CONFIG_CHANGE # not implemented yet
cec.EVENT_ALERT
cec.EVENT_MENU_CHANGED
cec.EVENT_ACTIVATED
cec.EVENT_ALL
# the callback will receive a varying number and type of arguments that are
# specific to the event. Contact me if you're interested in using specific
# callbacks

cec.remove_callback(handler, events)

devices = cec.list_devices()

class Device:
   __init__(id)
   is_on()
   power_on()
   standby()
   address
   physical_address
   vendor
   osd_string
   cec_version
   language
   is_active() # not implemented yet
   set_av_input(input)
   set_audio_input(input)

cec.is_active_source()
cec.set_active_source()  # not implemented yet
cec.set_inactive_source()  # not implemented yet

cec.volume_up()
cec.volume_down()
cec.toggle_mute()
# TODO: audio status

cec.set_physical_address(addr)
cec.can_persist_config()
cec.persist_config()
cec.set_port(device, port)
```
